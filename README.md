# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Project
###### Explain the purpose of this analysis

In this analysis we are working for a new company called PyBer, where we create visualizations of ride sharing data, filtered by city type. 
A number of data points are generated from the .csv files and presented to show trends among rides, fares, drivers, and locations. 
We ultimately created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to help make decisions at PyBer. 

## Results
###### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
We can see from our summary DataFrame shown below that the amount of rides is inversely proportional to the average fare per driver and total fares. 
As expected there is a stark contrast in the amount of rides when comparing Rural and Urban areas. In more rural areas the rides are also more expensive overall. 
We can see from our line chart below that the peak amount of fares occur in end part of February where there are a significant spike in revenue.

## Summary
###### Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
To address the disparity in the rural areas we could recommend an increase in price per miles paid to the driver, thus increasing thee average fare per driver and providing more incentives for more drivers to give rides in rural areas thus increasing overall rides. Another suggestion would be to reduce the overall cost of rural rides by subsidizing them, therefore bringing in more riders not on Pyber, and decreasing the fares paid to drivers in Urban areas. This would serve to lessen the gap between the two cities types. One last suggestion would be to lower the barrier to entry in the rural areas by being more lax in the kinds of cars Pyber allows to drive for them. Thinking that the cars in the rural areas would be older or of lesser quality greatly affects the barrier of entry in ride sharing.
